                <p>Every tour starts from square <b>Gazi Isa beg Isaković.</b>
                    The square, named after the city's founder, the Turkish warlord that Novi Pazar founded in 1461,
                    is one of the world's largest cities. Year. The same man founded Sarajevo and Sabac a few years
                    later. The city was built on such a site that it sits on a three-way road between Dubrovnik,
                    Thessaloniki and Carigrado (Istanbul) and was an ideal place for traders passing through.
                    Soon the city became a major trading centar. So much so that a few years after the founding of Novi
