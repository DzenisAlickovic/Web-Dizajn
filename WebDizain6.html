            <p>
                Altun - alem mosque is located on the central part of May Street. Turkish travel writer Evlija Čelebija,
                who travelled through these parts in the 1960s, wrote: "A mosque called Altun-alem is an old praying
                manmy, located in Jeleč -mahali on the Constantinople road. It is reliably known that altun-alem built
                the mosque, in the middle of the XVI century Musluhudin Abdul Gani. He is known as the builder of
                numerous buildings in other cities.
                In a 1550s vacuum. these Musluhuda ephenda facilities in Novi Pazar are listed: the Altun-alem mosque,
                the mecteb in the courtyard of the mosque, the famous han, six shops next to the hammam, three houses
                for the housing of imams, etc. The exact year of construction of the Altun-alem mosque is unknown, but
                it is assumed that this could be between 1516 and 1528. In any case, it is the first half of the XVI
                century.

            <p> There's little reliable information on this mosque. They are mentioned in the 1528 census, which speaks
                volumes that this building is very old and is one of the oldest buildings in Novi Pazar.
                It is preserved to assume that Hasan Čelebi was an Arab, and that the mosque is also called the Arab
                Mosque. The mosque was burned down in 1689 and later rebuilt. There is a tradition that the mosque was
                rebuilt by an Arab who was a Turkish officer in these parts, who later had a tombstone erected in a
                large cemetery known today as the "Tomb of Arabs".</p>
